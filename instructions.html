                <div class="text-box">Please place a webcam so that your face
                    points directly to it at all times. A camera positioned on top of
                    an additional monitor produces the best results.
                    
                    When ready to be monitored by the system, please press
                    "Start monitoring" button. The system projects your webcam
                    feed on  canvas located on "Home" page and begins
                    to analyse it utilising Machine Learning and Artificial
                    Intelligence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The analysing process occurs in user's
                    web browser. Therefore, no privacy issues arise from transmitting
                    user images over a network.
                    When the system concludes that there is a 90% or higher
                    probability that a user picks their nose, bites their
                    fingernails, turns the camera away or covers the camera,
                    a continuous loud
                    warning sound is played until a user stops these behaviours.
                    Please be aware that the warning sound is annoying!
                    In addition, user states and their detection accuracy are
                    displayed when a user is monitored.
