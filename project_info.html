                    This project is named “STOP IT! - Utilising Artificial Intelligence to
                    Prevent Anti-Social Behaviour Whilst Using a Computer”
                    because the project is aimed to reduce or
                    remove common anti-social behaviours of fingernail
                    biting and nose picking whilst using a computer with the
                    help of Machine Learning (ML) and 
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI).

                    This project’s viability is assessed by the general personal
                    observation of the increase and reliance in ubiquitous
                    computing especially in the lives of the young
                    at present. Further, it is observed that the
                    young increasingly manifest anti-social behaviours of
                    nail biting and nose picking when utilising a computer.
                    
                    Hence, there is a need for additional tools for parents
                    to decrease these behaviours in their children which this
                    project aims to provide. Please see "Instructions" for 
                    usage information.
